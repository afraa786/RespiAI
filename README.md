# RespirAI 
## AI-Driven Respiratory Disease Detection & Insight Provider

# Overview
###### RespirAI is an intelligent system designed to:
1. **Disease Detection** â€“ Identify respiratory conditions through a simple survey, supported by authentic medical data.
2. **In-Depth Information** â€“ Access detailed insights on diseases like Asthma, Tuberculosis, Pneumonia, Whooping Cough, Pulmonary Hypertension, Rhinitis, and GBS (Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome).
3. **AI-Powered Assistance** â€“ Get real-time answers to your queries about symptoms, causes, and treatments.
4. **Breath Test & Health Survey** â€“ Measure your respiratory health with a breath test timer and personalized surveys for tailored insights.

  #  **Setup & Installation** 
#### 1. **Frontend (Client) Setup**

1. Navigate to the `Client` directory:
   ```bash
   cd Client
   ```

2. Install the necessary Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

#### 2. **Model (ML) Setup with Docker**

1. Navigate to the `Models` directory:
   ```bash
   cd Models
   ```

2. Build the Docker image for the model:
   ```bash
   docker build -t conversational-pdf-rag .
   ```

3. Run the Docker container and expose the necessary ports:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 8501:8501 conversational-pdf-rag
   ```
#### 3. Server (Spring Boot) Setup
1. Navigate to the Spring Boot project directory:

```bash
cd Backend
```

2. Build the project using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

3. Run the Spring Boot application:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

4. Verify the server is running:
Open your browser or use a tool like Postman and visit:
```bash
GET http://localhost:8080/api/hello
```

5. Configure the database (DATABASE USED IN THIS PROJECT IS NEON):
Update the application.properties or application.yml file with your database credentials:
properties
```bash
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your-database
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=your-password
```

6. (Optional) Change the server port:
If you want to run the server on a different port, update the application.properties file:
properties
```bash
server.port=9090
```
